Algorithm


In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ (About this soundlisten)) is a sequence of instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or perform a computation.
Algorithms are unambiguous specifications for performing calculation, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.

As an effective method, an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time[1] and in a well-defined formal language[2] for calculating a function.
[3] Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty),[4] the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite[5] number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output"[6] and terminating at a final ending state.
The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.[7]

The concept of algorithm has existed for centuries. Greek mathematicians used algorithms in the sieve of Eratosthenes for finding prime numbers, and the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.[8]
